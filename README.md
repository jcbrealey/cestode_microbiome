# Microbiome profiling of cestode infection of Atlantic salmon
Code used for processing and analysis for Brealey et al. 2021. Microbiome inception: an intestinal cestode shapes a hierarchical landscape of distinct microbial communities nested within the host.

data: ASV count data, individual and sample metadata and MAG gene cluster data.
figures: all expected figures from R script.
maaslin2_out: output from Maaslin2 association tests.
reference_sequence_accessions: SILVA and Genbank accessions of mycoplasma and cestode reference sequences (16S, 18S and whole genomes) used in the analyses.

Raw sequencing data will be available from ENA soon/upon publication (project accession: PRJEBXXXXX).
